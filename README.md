A complete guide to x86 architecture, assembly, memory management, paging, segmentation, SMM, BIOS.... 
This book tends to overview and teach x86 subjects in the eyes of a reverse engineer, malware analyst or a hacker. We are not gonna teach you how to build an OS or other subjects that are not related to those mentioned above.

This Book will be completed and published in 3 volumes. I try to update the content as I write the book.
